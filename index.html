	<h1>Hi there, I'm Clement Cherlin!</h1>
	<p>I'm a computer programmer and software test engineer in the Indianapolis, Indiana area.</p>
	<p>Take a look at my <a href="portfolio">programming portfolio</a>.</p>
	<p>My most significant public work is the World of Warcraft AddOn <a href="portfolio/learningaid">Learning Aid</a>. I developed it in order to fix a number of problems I found in the game. Many people found it useful, and a few users translated it into French, German, Korean and Chinese (Simplified and Traditional).</p>
